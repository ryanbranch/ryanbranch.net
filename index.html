  <h3><strong>Welcome!</strong></h3>
  <p>You've found your way to <strong>ryanbranch.net</strong>, a domain owned by Ryan Branch.</p>
  <p>My main domain is <a href="https://ryanbran.ch/"><strong>ryanbran.ch</strong></a>. However, this uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ch">ccTLD for Switzerland</a> and so it is often excluded from search results elsewhere in the world.
  <p>The purpose of this website is to act as a landing page to direct users to my other content, primarily with the goal of making it easier to find the <a href="https://ryanbran.ch/"><strong>ryanbran.ch</strong></a> website.</p>
  <br />
